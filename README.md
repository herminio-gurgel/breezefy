Breezefy is a starter kit based on [Laravel Breeze](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/starter-kits#laravel-breeze)
, [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/), and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), with a significant difference: all components
have been refactored to use [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) instead of Tailwind CSS. This project provides a solid
foundation for quickly starting modern web applications with a well-defined structure and powerful styling.

## Key Features

- **[Laravel Breeze](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/starter-kits#laravel-breeze)**: Simple and robust authentication
  implementation.
- **[Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/)**: Adapter that allows building single-page applications (SPAs) using
  traditional backend frameworks.
- **[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)**: Progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
- **[Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/)**: Vue.js component library based on Material Design, replacing Tailwind CSS.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive, utilizing Vuetify's breakpoints based on the Material
  Design specification, to support both small screens (up to `sm` breakpoint) and larger screens (all breakpoints
  above `sm`).
- **Pre-configured Docker Compose**: Includes [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) for storage and [Mailpit](https://mailpit.axllent.org/) for
  testing email sending.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Docker**: To run Laravel Sail (https://www.docker.com/)
- **Docker Compose**: Comes with Docker Desktop

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and set up the project
using [Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x#docker-installation-using-sail):

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/herminio-gurgel/breezefy.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

    ```bash
    cd breezefy
    ```

3. **Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`**:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

4. **Install PHP dependencies**:

    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

5. **Start the Laravel Sail environment**:

    ```bash
    ./vendor/bin/sail up -d
    ```

6. **Install Node.js dependencies**:

    ```bash
    ./vendor/bin/sail npm install
    ```

7. **Build frontend assets**:

    ```bash
    ./vendor/bin/sail npm run build
    ```

8. **Generate the application key**:

    ```bash
    ./vendor/bin/sail artisan key:generate
    ```

9. **Run database migrations**:

    ```bash
    ./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate
    ```

10. **Access the Application**

After running these commands, you should be able to access the following:

- **Application**: [http://localhost](http://localhost)
- **Mailpit**: [http://localhost:8025](http://localhost:8025)
- **MySQL**:
    - **Using external clients**: You can connect to the MySQL database with the following default
      credentials:
        - **Host**: `localhost`
        - **Port**: `3306`
        - **Username**: `sail`
        - **Password**: `password`
    - **Using Laravel Sail**: To access the MySQL database directly, use the Sail command:
      ```bash
      ./vendor/bin/sail mysql
      ```

## Customization

To customize the project, follow these guidelines:

### Application Links

The application's main navigation is defined in two files located
in `resources/js/Layouts/AuthenticatedLayout/Partials/`.

The `NavigationLinks.vue` file stores links for navigating through the application bar. You can add, remove, or modify
these
navigation links to suit your needs:

```javascript
const navigationLinks = ref([
    {title: "Dashboard", namedRoute: "dashboard", method: ""},
    {title: "Your Route", namedRoute: "route-name", method: ""},
]);
```

The `MenuLinks.vue` file stores links for the dropdown menu, which is typically used for user configuration and actions.
You can customize these links as needed:

```javascript
const navigationLinks = ref([
    {title: "Profile", namedRoute: "profile.edit", method: ""},
    {title: "Preferences", namedRoute: "preference.index", method: ""},
    {title: "Log Out", namedRoute: "logout", method: "post"},
]);
```

### Vuetify Global Configuration

The global configuration for Vuetify includes important customization options to maintain the consistent layout of the
project. These settings can be adjusted in `resources/js/app.js` to better meet the needs of your project. For example,
the maximum width of the application is controlled by a single variable width `80rem`, making it easy to adjust:

```javascript
const maxWidth = '80rem'

const vuetify = createVuetify({
        ...,
        VAppBar: {
            ...,
            VRow: {
                ...,
                style: `max-width: ${maxWidth}`,
            }
        },
        VMain: {
            ...,
            maxWidth: maxWidth,
        },
        VFooter: {
            ...,
            style: `max-width: ${maxWidth}`
        },
        ...,
    })
;
```

By following these steps, you can start customizing Breezefy to better fit your specific requirements and build your
application on top of this robust starter kit.
